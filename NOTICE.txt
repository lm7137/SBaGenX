SBaGen+ is a fork of the original SBaGen software (https://uazu.net/sbagen/),
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2.

The full source code is available at:

For SBaGenX licensing information, see COPYING.txt.

This fork bundles dr_flac (https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs) for FLAC
decoding. dr_flac is available under public domain or MIT-0 terms.

This fork also bundles libsndfile's public header (libs/sndfile.h),
which is provided under the GNU LGPL v2.1+ by the libsndfile project.

At runtime, SBaGenX may load libsndfile and libmp3lame dynamically
to encode .ogg/.flac/.mp3 output files when selected.

Optional decode support may also use libogg, Tremor (libvorbisidec), and
libmad static libraries built by the project scripts.

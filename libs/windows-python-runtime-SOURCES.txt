Windows Python+Cairo runtime provenance (required Windows plotting backend)
===========================================================================

This file documents the provenance for the Windows plotting runtime trees:

  - libs/windows-win32-python-runtime/
  - libs/windows-win64-python-runtime/

These trees are used for high-quality graph rendering (`-G` and `-P`)
via `scripts/sbagenx_plot.py`.

Recommended upstream sources:

1) CPython embeddable package
   Source: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
   Suggested artifact names:
     - python-<version>-embed-win32.zip
     - python-<version>-embed-amd64.zip

2) pycairo (Python bindings)
   Source: https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/
   Install into each runtime's site-packages.

Note:
- Current pycairo wheels used by SBaGenX are self-contained for cairo
  symbols in this backend path; no separate cairo DLL package is needed
  for these runtime trees.

When distributing builds that bundle these runtimes, include and
publish the corresponding upstream license texts for:
  - CPython
  - pycairo
  - any bundled transitive runtime dependencies (if applicable)

Automation notes:

- windows-build-sbagenx.sh first checks for pre-existing runtime trees:
    - libs/windows-win32-python-runtime/
    - libs/windows-win64-python-runtime/
- then it can auto-extract these runtime trees from archives:
    - libs/windows-win32-python-runtime.zip
    - libs/windows-win64-python-runtime.zip
- then, if still missing, it auto-prepares runtimes from upstream
  CPython embeddable zips and matching pycairo wheels.
- It can also download archives when URLs are provided via:
    - SBAGENX_WIN32_PY_RUNTIME_URL
    - SBAGENX_WIN64_PY_RUNTIME_URL
